Welcome to one of the most complete projects I have worked on as of now on my web development course.

This project focuses on the usage of addEventListeners as well as the usage of high-order functions and annonymoyus functions. 

During this module I have learned and reviewed content I had studied before such as Objects, methods, constructors. 

While at the time I wrote this README the project is still in progress, so far it takes clicks and keypresses on the shown keys to reproduce sound. 

Later on animations will be added to the key when pressed or clicked.
